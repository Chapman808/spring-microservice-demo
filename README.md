# spring-microservice-demo

This is a sample project to demonstrate a simplified microservice environment in Spring Boot. The application accepts a message as well as as keyword and a 'substitution word' through its REST API. On the server side, the message is transformed and output is generated in its logs.

There are two microservices, the Incoming message API, and the message Processor API.
